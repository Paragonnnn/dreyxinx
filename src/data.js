        "Chang trudged through the snow-covered streets of his village, his feet heavy with exhaustion. The village was deadly silent, and as he approached his family's home, a sense of dread in the pit of his stomach. Something was wrong. The door to the house hung open, and as he stepped inside, he saw his mother's body lying in a pool of blood. As Chang stood frozen in shock and grief, he heard a muffled whimper from the shadows. He whirled around to see a young woman, trembling with fear, emerge from the corner of the room. 'Who did this?' he demanded, his voice hoarse with emotion. The woman stammered, 'I... I can't say... I'm sorry... I was only a witness.' As Chang stared at her in confusion, a young boy, no older than 10, emerged from the shadows. Wide, frightened eyes locked onto Chang, filling him with a sense of foreboding. 'It was General Bai!' the boy blurted out. 'He... he came here with his soldiers and... and...' The boy's words dissolved into sobs, unable to continue. Chang felt the pieces of the puzzle falling into place. He turned to the trembling woman and the sobbing boy. 'The Empire of Jade Throne has turned against us,' he said, his voice cold and determined. 'But we will not go down without a fight.' He grasped the hilt of his father's sword that was lying helplessly on a shelf and drew it from its scabbard. The blade gleamed in the dim light of the room. 'The enemies are headed for the Ancient Mountain. We must go and warn the others.' The little boy mumbled, his voice weak but urgent. As Chang stormed out of the room, the boy cried out, 'But you've only just begun cultivating! You've only just learned to harness the most basic form of qi. How can you possibly hope to defeat General Bai, who has been cultivating for decades? He's already close to immortality according to the rumors!' But Chang refused to listen. He felt the power of his own conviction welling up within him, and he knew he could not let doubt cloud his mind. He had to believe in himself, no matter what anyone else said. He was determined to prove that he could do this alone, that he did not need anyone's help. But as he left the village, he could not shake the boy's words from his mind. Could he really stand up to a cultivator as powerful as General Bai? The boy's skepticism weighed heavily on his heart. But he knew he had to try. Comparing himself to General Bai was worthless, it's nothing more than suicide! He found a small, sturdy-looking home on the outskirts of the village. It's not much to look at, but it has a roof and four walls, and it's not far from the path that leads to the ancient mountain. He took a deep breath, readied his gear, and started off on the path, praying that he's not too late. As he walked, he felt the weight of the task ahead of him. He spotted a horse grazing in a field, just off the path. The horse's coat was the color of burnished copper, and it tossed its mane as if it sensed Chang's gaze upon it. As he approached, the horse whinnied and tossed its head, but allowed him to draw near and take hold of its reins. As he rode, the once-familiar landscape is now blackened and charred. The thatched roofs of houses have been reduced to ash, and he can see the broken bodies of the villagers lying in the streets. Chang guided the horse around a bend in the path and found himself face-to-face with General Bai. Behind the general, thousands of soldiers stood at attention, their armor glinting in the sun. For a moment, the two men simply stared at each other. Then, General Bai spoke, his voice like thunder. 'So, you've come to challenge me, boy? You are brave, I'll give you that. But foolish.' Xiang dismounted from his horse and approached his father, his eyes blazing with defiance. 'Let me handle him, father,' he said. 'I am a match for this insolent whelp.' He said that even though he didn't know Chang's level of cultivation. But General Bai held up a hand, his expression unreadable. 'No, my son. This one is mine to defeat.' With those words, he drew his sword and advanced on Chang. General Bai's sword flashed in the sunlight as he swung it towards Chang. But in a blur of movement, Chang deflected the blow and countered with a strike of his own. General Bai's sword waved gently, like he was hesitant to strike Chang. The two men traded blows, their swords clashing and ringing in the air. But then, General Bai feinted to the left and landed a blow on Chang's shoulder, knocking him to the ground. As Chang lay there, dazed and bleeding, General Bai leveled his sword at his throat. 'Begone, boy,' he snarled. General Bai raised up his sword for the final blow, but Chang smiled defiantly. 'You may defeat my body, but my spirit will never die.' General Bai then asked politely, a mischievous smile on his face. 'Any last wish?' His sword remained poised to strike. 'I want to come back as a warrior and avenge all the lives you've taken today,' Chang replied, sobbing, but his eyes filled with determination. He closed his eyes and accepted his fate. The sword came down in a flash of steel, and Chang felt a searing pain as it bit into his flesh. He tried to cry out, but no sound came from his lips. The world seemed to slow around him, and he saw the faces of his loved ones flash before his eyes. And then, darkness. His body lay crumpled on the ground, and the soldiers who had accompanied General Bai stood around him, impassive. Without a word, they grabbed his body and threw it into a ditch. After disposing of Chang's body, General Bai turned to his son, Xiang. 'Go to the Ancient Mountain,' he said, his voice cold and commanding. 'There you will find what you need to become a great leader, to bring back all the officials to our side. And when you return, we will take our rightful place as rulers of Jade kingdom.' With that, he mounted his horse and rode away, leaving Xiang alone with his thoughts. Xiang followed his father's orders and made his way to the Ancient Mountain. It was a long and arduous journey, but he was determined to complete it. As he neared the summit, he came upon a cliff overlooking a vast valley. And there, at the edge of the cliff, he saw a glint of gold. A chest, filled with glittering coins and jewels, lay half-hidden in the grass. As he crept closer to the treasure chest, he could hear a faint cracking sound beneath his feet. The ground was starting to give way! He froze, not daring to move an inch. He looked down and saw a large, circular crack spreading out from his boots. He knew he had to act quickly. But if he moved, he risked falling into the chasm below. Despite the danger, Xiang stretched out his hand towards the treasure chest. He managed to grab hold of a single gold coin, but it was too late. The ground beneath him gave way completely, and he tumbled over the edge of the cliff. He let out a scream as he fell, the wind whipping past him and the treasure chest growing smaller and smaller above him. Then, everything went black. Xiang's eyes fluttered open again, but his vision was hazy. Everything seemed foreign, like he was seeing the world through someone else's eyes. He blinked repeatedly, trying to focus. As his surroundings came into view, he saw a strange, otherworldly landscape stretching out before him. Xiang realized he was no longer the same person. His body felt transformed, infused with an otherworldly power. He looked down at his glowing hand and felt a surge of confusion. 'Xiang?' General Bai boomed, his voice echoing across the landscape. 'I thought you said he fell from the high cliff,' General Bai said, turning to the guards who had brought him the tragic news. 'How is he still alive?' The guards shifted nervously, unable to meet his gaze. They couldn't understand what happened, they clearly saw him tumbling down the cliff. He turned, his eyes wide with confusion. Moments ago, the sharp blades of General Bai's sword had slashed at him, yet he lived again. Why? Had he been given a second chance? 'I'm not Xiang,' he whispered, his voice trembling. 'I'm Chang...' But his words trailed off, lost in the wind. General Bai didn't seem to hear, too relieved that his son was alive. He rushed towards him with a mix of joy and confusion. Xiang, now Chang, watched as General Bai approached, unsure of what to do next. Formidable power surged through Chang's new form, Xiang's body. He glared at General Bai, who hugged him, oblivious. 'Interesting! I smell revenge!' Chang thought, as he seethed with a mix of emotions, feeling Xiang's strength grow.",

It was a long and arduous journey, but he was determined to complete it. As he neared the summit, he came upon a cliff overlooking a vast valley. And there, at the edge of the cliff, he saw a glint of gold. A chest, filled with glittering coins and jewels, lay half-hidden in the grass. As he crept closer to the treasure chest, he could hear a faint cracking sound beneath his feet. The ground was starting to give way! He froze, not daring to move an inch. He looked down and saw a large, circular crack spreading out from his boots. He knew he had to act quickly. But if he moved, he risked falling into the chasm below. Despite the danger, Xiang stretched out his hand towards the treasure chest. He managed to grab hold of a single gold coin, but it was too late. The ground beneath him gave way completely, and he tumbled over the edge of the cliff. He let out a scream as he fell, the wind whipping past him and the treasure chest growing smaller and smaller above him. Then, everything went black. Xiang's eyes fluttered open again, but his vision was hazy. Everything seemed foreign, like he was seeing the world through someone else's eyes. He blinked repeatedly, trying to focus. As his surroundings came into view, he saw a strange, otherworldly landscape stretching out before him. Xiang realized he was no longer the same person. His body felt transformed, infused with an otherworldly power. He looked down at his glowing hand and felt a surge of confusion. 'Xiang?' General Bai boomed, his voice echoing across the landscape. 'I thought you said he fell from the high cliff,' General Bai said, turning to the guards who had brought him the tragic news. 'How is he still alive?' The guards shifted nervously, unable to meet his gaze. They couldn't understand what happened, they clearly saw him tumbling down the cliff. He turned, his eyes wide with confusion. Moments ago, the sharp blades of General Bai's sword had slashed at him, yet he lived again. Why? Had he been given a second chance? 'I'm not Xiang,' he whispered, his voice trembling. 'I'm Chang...' But his words trailed off, lost in the wind. General Bai didn't seem to hear, too relieved that his son was alive. He rushed towards him with a mix of joy and confusion. Xiang, now Chang, watched as General Bai approached, unsure of what to do next. Formidable power surged through Chang's new form, Xiang's body. He glared at General Bai, who hugged him, oblivious. 'Interesting! I smell revenge!' Chang thought, as he seethed with a mix of emotions, feeling Xiang's strength grow.",
